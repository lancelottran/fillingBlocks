You have a block with the dimensions 4 × n. Find the number of different ways you can fill this block with smaller blocks that have the dimensions 1 × 2. You are allowed to rotate the smaller blocks.

Example

For n = 1, the output should be
fillingBlocks(n) = 1.

There is only one possible way to arrange the smaller 1 × 2 blocks inside the 4 × 1 block.

For n = 4, the output should be
fillingBlocks(n) = 36.
